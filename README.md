# [WIP] traffic_light_detection
Here I will show how to you can develope a deep model to detect *traffic lights* and *their status*. To do so, I proposed two approaches:
1) using **TensorflowAPI** which is a quick way to develop your own object detection/classification modules
2) developing a deep neural network **from scratch** using tensorflow
